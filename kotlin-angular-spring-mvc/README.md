kotlin-angular-spring-mvc
=========================

This project uses spring framework for the backend of a restful application.

There is no java or xml files. All the configuration is made using kotlin.

Spring MVC is used to handle the htpp request. Jackon manages the kotlin to json
transformation.

The domain is done with JPAÂ and Inject annotations (hibernate implementation)

A small angular.js application demonstrates the efficiency of this minimal
 configuration.
