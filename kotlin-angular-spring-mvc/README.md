kotlin-angular-spring-mvc
=========================

This project uses spring framework for the backend of a restful application.

There is no java or xml files. All the configuration is made using kotlin.

Spring dependency injection is used to provide a repository access in the
 controller.

Jackon manages the kotlin to json transformation.

A small angular.js application demonstrates the efficiency of this minimal
 configuration.
